            <p>Welcome to Taal High School's IamtheCODE Journey — a story of curiosity, collaboration, and digital
                empowerment.</p>
            This initiative thrives through the collective support of our school leaders, dedicated ICT team, and the
            passionate teacher facilitators who guide and inspire every learner. Together, they help shape an
            environment
            where innovation is encouraged and every student is empowered to explore the world of coding.
            Guided by the spirit of the iamtheCODE movement, our journey goes beyond learning programming skills—it is
            about
            building confidence, fostering collaboration, and opening doors to new possibilities.
            As you explore our story, we hope you feel the determination, hope, and excitement that fuel our mission to
            create
            a brighter, more inclusive digital future for all.</p>
